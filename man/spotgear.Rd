\details{
Autoimmune diseases, e.g., scleroderma, are human immune systemâ€™s
responses to autoantigens in which the body produces specific autoantibodies
that target these autoantigens but also cause tissue damage. The autoantibody
composition is strikingly different among patients, as indicated by the many
different radiolabeled patterns obtained from the mass-spectrometry-based
technology - gel electrophoresis autoradiograms (GEA). Human recognition of
patterns is not optimal when the patterns are composite/complex, or patterns
are scattered across a large number of samples. However, multiple sources of
error (including irrelevant intensity differences across gels and warping of
the gels) have traditionally precluded automation of pattern discovery using
autoradiograms. In this package, we overcome these limitations by novel initial
gel data preprocessing (Bayesian two dimensional image dewarping/registration) and then provide methods to
