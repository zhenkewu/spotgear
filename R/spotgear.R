#'
#' Autoimmune diseases, e.g., scleroderma, are human immune systemâ€™s
#' responses to autoantigens in which the body produces specific autoantibodies
#' that target these autoantigens but also cause tissue damage. The autoantibody
#' composition is strikingly different among patients, as indicated by the many
#' different radiolabeled patterns obtained from the mass-spectrometry-based
#' technology - gel electrophoresis autoradiograms (GEA). Human recognition of
#' patterns is not optimal when the patterns are composite/complex, or patterns
#' are scattered across a large number of samples. However, multiple sources of
#' error (including irrelevant intensity differences across gels and warping of
#' the gels) have traditionally precluded automation of pattern discovery using
#' autoradiograms. In this package, we overcome these limitations by novel initial
#' gel data preprocessing (Bayesian two dimensional image dewarping/registration) and then provide methods to
#  detect disease subgroups.
