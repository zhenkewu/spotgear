Description: In many diseases, the targets of autoantibodies are incompletely 
    defined. Although the technologies for autoantibody discovery have 
    advanced dramatically over the past decade, each of these techniques 
    generates hundreds of possibilities, which are onerous and expensive to 
    validate. We set out to establish a method to greatly simplify 
    autoantibody discovery, using a pre-filtering step to define subgroups 
    with similar specificities based on migration of radiolabeled, 
    immunoprecipitated proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels and 
    autoradiography [Gel Electrophoresis and band detection on 
    Autoradiograms (GEA)]. Human recognition of patterns is not optimal 
    when the patterns are complex or scattered across many samples. 
    Multiple sources of errors - including irrelevant intensity differences 
    and warping of gels - have challenged automation of pattern discovery 
    from autoradiograms. In this package, we address these limitations using 
    a Bayesian hierarchical model with shrinkage priors for pattern alignment 
    and spatial dewarping. The Bayesian model combines information from 
    multiple gel sets and corrects spatial warping for coherent estimation 
    of autoantibody signatures defined by presence or absence of a grid of 
    landmark proteins. The pre-processing method creates more clearly 
    separated clusters and improves the accuracy of autoantibody subset 
    detection via hierarchical clustering.
